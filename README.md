 ANAS- PORTFOLIO-WEBSITE-USING-REACT -JS
 A React portfolio website is a dynamic and responsive platform designed to showcase an individual's work, skills, and experience in a visually appealing and interactive manner. This website features both light and dark themes, allowing users to switch between them based on their preferences or time of day, enhancing the user experience. The portfolio includes a fully functional contact form that enables visitors to easily reach out. Form validation is implemented to ensure that all inputs are correct before submission, providing a seamless interaction and reducing errors. React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, are utilized extensively throughout the site to manage state and side effects efficiently, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user interface. The useState hook manages the application's dynamic states, such as theme toggling and form inputs, while useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or updating the document title. Additionally, the Context API is employed to manage and share global state across different components, like theme preferences or user authentication status, without the need for prop drilling. Overall, the React portfolio website is a modern, efficient, and user-friendly platform, perfect for showcasing a developer's abilities while providing an intuitive experience for visitors.
